| Chick-fil-A  | 1 | The bright salty flavor and extra tender meat that result from brining are consistent with what we expect from this chicken-focused fast food chain! Chick-fil-A sauce has a smoky, sweet, creamy flavor that can be slightly compared to BBQ sauce. In fact, Chick-fil-A sauce was created when BBQ sauce was accidentally mixed with a honey mustard recipe that was prepared. |
