## Flavour Ranking

| Resturant Name | Rank Order | Comments | Picture 
| Chick-fil-A  | 1 | The bright salty flavor and extra tender meat that result from brining are consistent with what we expect from this chicken-focused fast food chain! Chick-fil-A sauce has a smoky, sweet, creamy flavor that can be slightly compared to BBQ sauce. In fact, Chick-fil-A sauce was created when BBQ sauce was accidentally mixed with a honey mustard recipe that was prepared. | <img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/chickfila.PNG">
