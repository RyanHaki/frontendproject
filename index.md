[In-N-Out Information](https://www.in-n-out.com){: .btn}


| Resturant Name | Rank Order | Comments | Picture 
| Chick-fil-A  | 1 | The bright salty flavor and extra tender meat that result from brining are consistent with what we expect from this chicken-focused fast food chain! Chick-fil-A sauce has a smoky, sweet, creamy flavor that can be slightly compared to BBQ sauce. In fact, Chick-fil-A sauce was created when BBQ sauce was accidentally mixed with a honey mustard recipe that was prepared. | <img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/chickfila.PNG">
| Chipotle | 2 | Chipotle's menu has mutliple ingredients to create an indivudal plate with very flavorul and good quality meat and vegetables. The Chips at Chipotle is very popular and liked amongst the cusutomers | <img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/chipotle.PNG">
| In-N-Out | 3 | Their patties are free of additives, fillers, and preservatives of any kind. But it's just not the meat. The lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese are all fresh, too. The fires and potateos also outcompete their compettiors in terms of flavor as | <img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/In-N-out.PNG">
| Subway  |  4  |   Bread choices, the “lubrication” of the sandwich, the use of fats, the seasoning of vegetables, and the strategic stacking of ingredients. These are all the main reasons why Subway is so delicious and is a fan favorite |  <img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/ssubway.PNG">
| Taco Bell | 5  | Taco Bell has managed the perfect blend of seasonings and have replicated the taste of mexican food to make the cutsomers keep coming back for more. They used a blend of onion, garlic, sugar, and beef boullon granuiles. | <img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/tacobell.PNG">
| Carl's Jr. | 6 | Carls jr offers fresh produce, wide range of items, usually really fast. They have high quality ingredients and very fast without delay. The mastered a perfect blend of fresh and barbacue with having burgers. | <img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/carls.PNG">
| Burger King | 7 | Each Whopper sandwich is created with 100% beef, allowing for the natural, juicy flavor of a real burger. With no fillers, preservatives, or additives, the Whopper is made with 1/4lb of flame-grilled beef and freshly prepared for each order. | <img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/burgerking.PNG">
| Mc'Donalds | 8 | Mc'Donalds is has decnet burgers but do not put enough effort into their burgers and sandwhiches. But their breakfast meals are good with a combination of pancackes, sandwhich, and bacon. | <img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/mcodnals.PNG">
| Wendy's | 9 | The best option in Wendy's is definetly the bacinator because of the amount of bacon and sacue that are in there which makes it flavorful. Other than that, there are not much options which outcompetes the other fast food resturants |  <img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/wendyhs.PNG">
| Jack in The Box | 10 | Jack in The box dosen't have much special, almost every other resturant has something unique about their food but Jack in the box seems like a worse version of Mc-Donalds | <img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/jack.PNG">
