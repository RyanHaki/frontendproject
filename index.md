| Chick-fil-A  | 1 | Chick-fil-A is considered one of the healthier fast food joints. Their portions are smaller then other fast food restaurants, they have grilled options and they don't serve any desserts (except ice cream). Their chicken wraps are the best options, but you can always go for their chicken nuggets and waffle fries. |
